            <p>The mission of our Robotics Club is to unite students in an educational environment and provide
                students a place to pursue their interest in mechanical, electronic, and software design by working
                on large and small scale robotics projects. Having said that we take pride in talking about our
                projects, be it autonomous bots, humanoids, swarm of tiny robots, robotic arms or aerial vehicles,
                we haven't left any stone unturned. However, the club provides much more than just technical growth
                to its members, from team-building to cooperation, from perseverance to sincerity, the club teaches
                you a myriad of interpersonal skills essential in daily life.</p>
